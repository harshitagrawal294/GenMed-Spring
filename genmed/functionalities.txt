From user's view :

    Should be able to search shops having a certain medicine. ( under different criterias ).
    Should be able to search shops.
    Should have an account ( thus we need to setup the authentication system )
    Can order items from different shops.
    Can view their previous order details.
    The search page will also have a map that will show the marks of all the points.


From shop's view :

    Should be able to login to see the current info about the shops income and current details.
    Should be able to view the general information about the shop and should be able to modify the shop.
    Should be able to view and manage the staffs, and inventory ( add or delete items from the inventory ).
    Should have a pending orders screen from where they can view the pending orders.

    Should also be able to keep track of supply orders made from the manufactures and what is the status of those orders.

    The main dash board will show the revenue of the shop.

    The problem here is to keep a check that one shop owner can't check the info of other shop. Well this can be done by checking the authentication of these pages.


    NOTE : Once the medicine in the shop is off then the table from the inventory also must be deleted.

Later :
    Apart from this one another problem is how to make a master list of the generic medicine drug mapping with their custom drugs ( This needs to be verified )
    Moreover one needs to add some information about ehat a generic medicine is used for, means what does it treat and what are it's other branded conterparts.
    Should add a search screen that searches and gives the information about the medicine. ( Should be filtered by the generic name or brand name ).
